# Automated Document Generation: From Spreadsheet to Personalized Word Docs

This roadmap guides you through building a Python application that automates the process of generating multiple Word documents from a single template and a list of contents in a spreadsheet. You will learn to parse data, manipulate Word documents programmatically, and create a robust solution for personalized document creation.

📊 **4 Phases** | **13 Tasks**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- python-docx (latest stable)
- pandas (latest stable)
- openpyxl (for Excel support with pandas)

## 📋 Requirements
- Read data from a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel or CSV).
- Identify and utilize a Word document template with predefined headers and content placeholders.
- Insert dynamic content from each row of the spreadsheet into the template.
- Generate a new, personalized Word document for each row of content from the spreadsheet.
- Maintain the integrity of the Word document template's header across all generated documents.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The application successfully processes a given Word document template and an Excel/CSV spreadsheet.
- [ ] For each row of data in the spreadsheet, a unique Word document is generated.
- [ ] The generated documents maintain the static header content from the original template.
- [ ] All specified placeholders in the template are correctly replaced with corresponding data from the spreadsheet rows.
- [ ] The application handles common file-related errors gracefully (e.g., missing template, missing data file).
- [ ] The application is runnable via command-line arguments, allowing users to specify input/output paths.
- [ ] A clear `README.md` file is provided, detailing setup, configuration, and usage.
